kept with deprecation notice.

# motifmatchr 0.99.6

Genome no longer defaults to hg19 when subject is GenomicRanges or
RangedSummarizedExperiment, but tries to pull assoicated genome build from
object. Genome can be provided as BSgenome, FaFile, DNAStringSet object, or
short string (e.g. "hg19").

Added BSgenomeViews method.
